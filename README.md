## Karpix OS

The control box runs a custom linux known internally as "Karpix" after its creator. This repository contains select parts of th eroot filesystem in order to allow versioning parts of the OS. Binary files aren't included generally, and configuration files generally are.

The purpose of this linux build is to provide an environment to run the [EM Control Box System](https://github.com/Ecotrust-Canada/em-control-box).
